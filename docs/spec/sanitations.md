# Sanitation for OpenAPI specification

This document records the sanitation done on top of the official OpenAPI specification from Constant Contact.
The OpenAPI specification is obtained from [wso2/api-specs](https://github.com/wso2/api-specs/blob/main/openapi/constantcontact/constantcontact/3.0.193/openapi.yaml).
These changes are done in order to improve the overall usability, and as workarounds for some known language limitations.

1. **Swagger 2.0 converted to OpenAPI 3.0**

   The source is a Swagger 2.0 document. `bal openapi flatten` and `bal openapi align` convert it to OpenAPI 3.0 and set the server URL to `https://api.cc.email/v3` (the `host` and `basePath` of the source).

2. **Removed the binary `example` on the `file` property of the contact CSV import body**

   `flatten` emitted the source's `x-example` as a YAML `!!binary` value, which cannot be serialized to JSON. The `example` was dropped from `ActivitiesContactsFileImportBody.file`.

3. **Stable operation IDs**

   Operation IDs such as `retrieveEmailCampaignUsingGET`, `postTagAddContact` and `getEvent_2` were replaced by `list*`/`get*`/`create*`/`update*`/`delete*` names (for example `listEmailCampaigns`, `createTagAddContactsActivity`, `getEvent`). The decisions are persisted in `ai-mappings.json`, keyed by path and method. Schema names were kept as they are in the source.

4. **Descriptions for generic success responses**

   103 success responses on 98 operations were described only as `Request successful`, `Request was successful`, `OK`, `Accepted` or `successful operation`. These descriptions become the `# + return` documentation of the client methods, so they were rewritten in the aligned spec (`aligned_ballerina_openapi.json`) to describe what is returned. Details the originals carried, such as `queued for processing` on the bulk activity endpoints and the legacy (V7) conversion note on `createEmailCampaign`, were kept. `openapi.yaml` is unchanged, so these edits must be re-applied to the aligned spec whenever it is regenerated.

5. **Mock server only: status code `209` remapped**

   `listAutomations` documents a `209` response that `bal openapi --mode service` rejects. The mock-only copy of the spec maps it to `200`; the published spec is unchanged.

6. **Generated client patched: multipart body of `importContactsCsv`**

   The generated client converts the `ActivitiesContactsFileImportBody` payload to JSON before building the multipart body, so the CSV file was sent as a JSON text part (`{"fileContent":[101,...]}`) with no file name. `client.bal` was edited by hand to pass the form fields to `createBodyParts` directly:

   ```ballerina
   mime:Entity[] bodyParts = check createBodyParts({
       "file": payload.file,
       "sms_permission_to_send": payload.smsPermissionToSend,
       "list_ids": payload.listIds
   });
   ```

   `file` is now sent as a file part with its name, and the wire names `sms_permission_to_send` and `list_ids` are kept. When `smsPermissionToSend` is not set, no part is sent for it. This is a change to generated code, not to the spec, so it must be re-applied to `client.bal` whenever the client is regenerated.

## OpenAPI cli command

The following command was used to generate the Ballerina client from the OpenAPI specification. The command should be executed from the repository root directory.

```bash
bal openapi -i docs/spec/aligned_ballerina_openapi.json -o ballerina --mode client --license docs/license.txt --client-methods remote
```

Note: The license year is hardcoded to 2024, change if necessary.
